  <h1 contenteditable>Introduction to HTML</h1>
  <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. HTML describes the structure of a Web page. HTML consists of a series of elements. HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content.</p>
  <p>
      HTML is a markup language used by the browser to manipulate text, images, and other content, in order to display it in the required format. HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. The first-ever version of HTML was HTML 1.0, but the first standard version was HTML 2.0, published in 1995.

    DOCTYPE html: This is the document type declaration (not technically a tag). It declares a document as being an HTML document. The doctype declaration is not case-sensitive.
    html: This is called the HTML root element. All other elements are contained within it.
    head: The head tag contains the “behind the scenes” elements for a webpage. Elements within the head are not visible on the front-end of a webpage. HTML elements used inside the <head> element include: 
    style:This html tag allows us to insert styling into our webpages and make them appealing to look at with the help of CSS.
    title: -The title is what is displayed on the top of your browser when you visit a website and contains title of the webpage that you are viewing.
    base: It specifies the base URL for all relative URLs in a document.
    noscript: Defines a section of HTML that is inserted when the scripting has been turned off in the users browser.
    An HTML document can be created using any text editor. Save the text file using .html or .htm. Once saved as an HTML document, the file can be opened as a webpage in the browser.
